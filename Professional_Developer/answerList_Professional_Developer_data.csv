I'm lead to belief there's some else in the code I can't see that's calling a method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double).  Because the output indicates the code compiles and doesn't receive a runtime exception.    Assuming the method with the signature TimePeriodValues.add(SimpleTimePeriod; double) is calling updateBounds(TimePeriod; int); this seems a little off because updateBounds takes an int.

It is signed; and is only used with other longs. I'm a little unsure; though; because doing the division after the variable definition could result in a real number and not an integer (we'll lose precision). Maybe it should be a double? However; longs are used throughout the method; so the loss of precision should balance out (i.e we won't compare a long that's been truncated to a double that still contains the fractional component).,1,1,333aA2c-1a4-28,5,Professional_Developer,32,48,Male,High School;University;Web,United States,C++; PHP; JavaScript; HTML

I assume that add() appends a string onto the same var that add() appends onto (though I don't see why one would need both) and this section is putting a space in between any preceding '-' in the input and any '-' to be appended that represents the first char of a negative number.  addNumber would better be called concatNumberStr() or similar I think.,5,3,47Gi2a9C33-3,4,Professional_Developer,25,53,Male,University,US,perl; c; javascript; php
